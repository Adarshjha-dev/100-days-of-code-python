### 📅 Day 28: Pomodoro Timer ⏱️🍅

A graphical Pomodoro timer application built using Tkinter that helps users stay productive by alternating between focused work sessions and breaks.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Implements the Pomodoro technique:  
  - 25 min work → 5 min short break  
  - Every 4th break is a 20 min long break  
- Tracks sessions and displays checkmarks for each completed work interval  
- Includes Start and Reset functionality  
- Displays a dynamic countdown timer and updates the UI accordingly

#### 📝 What I Learned
- How to work with the Canvas Widget and Add Images to Tkinter  
- Dynamic Typing  
- Using `after()` for scheduling repeated actions in a GUI  
- Updating canvas text dynamically with `itemconfig()`  
- Managing application state across multiple function calls  
- Structuring a timer-based GUI application
