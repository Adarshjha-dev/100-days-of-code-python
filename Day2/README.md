### 📅 Day 2: Tip Calculator

A simple Python program that helps split a bill among people, including a customizable tip.

#### 🧠 What It Does

- Asks for a tip percentage (10, 12, or 15)  
- Asks how many people to split the bill  
- Calculates how much each person should pay

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Data Types  
- Type Error, Type Checking, and Type Conversion  
- Performing arithmetic operations  
- Operator precedence and order of operations  
- Using `round()` for formatting decimals  
- `f-strings` for string interpolation
