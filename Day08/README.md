### 📅 Day 8: Caesar Cipher

A text encryption and decryption tool based on the Caesar Cipher — one of the simplest and most well-known ciphers.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Lets users choose between encoding and decoding a message  
- Shifts each letter by a specified number  
- Wraps around the alphabet (handles overflow)  
- Preserves non-alphabet characters  
- Allows user to repeat the process or exit

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Functions with Inputs  
- Positional vs. Keyword Arguments  
- Caesar Cipher logic and modular arithmetic  
- Creating reusable functions  

#### 💻 Example
