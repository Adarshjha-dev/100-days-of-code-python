### 📅 Day 13: Debugging Exercises 🔍

A set of three short Python programs focused on debugging common issues like logic errors, edge cases, and loop behavior.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Demonstrates typical Python bugs and how to fix them  
- Covers control flow, conditionals, and loop-based logic  
- Reinforces careful reading of code and understanding program behavior

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Describing the problem  
- Reproducing the bug  
- Playing computer and evaluating each line  
- Squashing bugs with a `print()` statement  
- Using a debugger
