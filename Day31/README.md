### 📅 Day 31: Flashcard Language App 🧠

An interactive flashcard app built with Tkinter to help users learn French vocabulary by testing themselves with timed flashcards.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Displays a French word and automatically flips to show the English translation after 3 seconds  
- Allows users to mark words as known or unknown  
- Removes known words from the learning set and updates progress in a CSV file  
- Saves user progress across sessions using `words_to_learn.csv`  
- Utilizes images and a GUI layout for an engaging learning experience

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Create the User Interface (UI) with Tkinter  
- Create New Flash Cards  
- Flip the Cards  
- Save Study Progress
