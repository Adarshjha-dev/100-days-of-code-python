### 📅 Day 6: Reeborg's World Maze Escape

A simple maze-solving algorithm created for Reeborg’s World. Reeborg finds the exit by following the wall on its right-hand side.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Turns right if there's no wall on the right  
- Moves forward if the path ahead is clear  
- Turns left if blocked from both right and front  
- Repeats the logic until Reeborg reaches the goal

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Python functions  
- Indentation in Python  
- `while` loops  
- Basic maze-solving logic

#### 💻 Example
