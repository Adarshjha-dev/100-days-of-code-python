### 📅 Day 12: Number Guessing Game 🎯

A fun command-line game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number within a limited number of attempts.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Randomly selects a number between 1 and 100  
- Prompts the user to choose a difficulty level (`easy` or `hard`)  
- Gives the player limited attempts to guess the correct number  
- Provides feedback whether the guess is too high or too low  
- Ends when the number is guessed or attempts run out

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Namespaces: Local vs Global Scope  
- Modifying a Global Variable  
- Python Constants and Global Scope
