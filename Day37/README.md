### 📅 Day 37: Habit Tracking with Pixela 📊

A Python script that interacts with the Pixela API to visually track daily habits — in this case, reading progress.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Connects to the [Pixela](https://pixe.la) habit-tracking API  
- Creates a user account (commented for one-time setup)  
- Sets up a custom graph to track reading progress  
- Logs daily data entries (pages read) as "pixels"  
- Supports updating and deleting data for specific dates  

#### 📝 What I Learned
- How to make HTTP POST requests with `requests`  
- Advanced authentication using custom HTTP headers  
- Autofilling dates using `strftime` from the `datetime` module  
- Using HTTP PUT and DELETE requests for updating/deleting data
