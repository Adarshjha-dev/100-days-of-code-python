### 📅 Day 10: Calculator Project

A simple calculator app built in Python that supports continuous operations using functions and a loop.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Supports basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
- Prompts user for numbers and operation  
- Uses function references stored in a dictionary  
- Allows user to continue calculations with the previous result or start over  
- Displays a logo using external ASCII art

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Functions with output  
- Returning multiple values  
- Using docstrings for documentation  
- Difference between `print()` and `return`  
- Using flags and recursion in logic  
- Storing functions as values in a dictionary
