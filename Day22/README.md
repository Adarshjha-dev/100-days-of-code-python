### 📅 Day 22: Pong Game 🕹️

A classic arcade Pong game built using the Turtle graphics module in Python. Two players control paddles to bounce the ball back and forth, with scoring and increasing difficulty.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Sets up a game screen using Turtle graphics  
- Allows two-player paddle control using keyboard keys  
- Ball bounces off walls and paddles  
- Score is updated when the ball passes a paddle  
- Game runs in a loop with increasing ball speed

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Working with Turtle graphics to create interactive visuals  
- Object-oriented programming with multiple classes (`Paddle`, `Ball`, `Scoreboard`)  
- Handling keyboard events for real-time user input  
- Collision detection and response  
- Game loop and screen updates using `screen.tracer()` and `time.sleep()`
