### 📅 Day 7: Hangman Game

A Python implementation of the classic Hangman game, where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Selects a random word from a predefined list  
- Displays blank spaces for each letter in the word  
- Takes letter guesses from the player  
- Reveals correct letters and tracks previously guessed ones  
- Deducts a life for each incorrect guess  
- Uses ASCII art to visually represent remaining lives  
- Ends the game with a win or loss message

#### 📝 What I Learned
- How to break down a complex problem into a flowchart  
- How to check the user’s input and validate guesses  
- Improving the user experience with clear feedback  
- How to add ASCII art and enhance the UI using visuals  
- Managing game state with loops, conditions, and variables  
- Working with external Python modules and importing data
