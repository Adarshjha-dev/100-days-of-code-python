### 📅 Day 16: OOP Coffee Machine ☕

A modular, object-oriented program that simulates a coffee machine. It integrates multiple classes to handle menu options, machine resources, and transactions.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Uses `Menu`, `CoffeeMaker`, and `MoneyMachine` classes to separate concerns  
- Displays drink options (espresso, latte, cappuccino)  
- Allows user to request drinks, check reports, or shut down the machine  
- Validates resources and processes payments before brewing coffee  
- Continuously loops until turned off

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Classes and Objects  
- Constructing Objects and Accessing their Attributes and Methods  
- Modifying Object Attributes and Calling Methods  
- How to Add Python Packages and use PyPi  
- Encapsulation and object-oriented design in Python
