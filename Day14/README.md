### 📅 Day 14: Higher Lower Game 🔼🔽

A social media-themed comparison game where players guess which personality has more followers.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Randomly selects two accounts from a dataset  
- Displays brief info about each account  
- Asks the user to guess which account has more followers  
- Increases score for each correct guess  
- Ends when the player guesses incorrectly

#### 📝 What I Learned
- How to structure data using dictionaries and lists  
- Refactoring code with helper functions (`format_data`, `is_correct`)  
- Managing game state with conditionals and loops  
- Improving user experience with ASCII art and data formatting
