### 📅 Day 35: Rain Alert via SMS ☔

A Python automation script that checks the weather forecast and sends an SMS alert if rain is expected in the next 12 hours.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Fetches weather forecast data using OpenWeatherMap API  
- Checks condition codes to detect rain  
- Sends an SMS notification using Twilio if rain is predicted  
- Uses environment variables to keep credentials secure

#### 📝 What I Learned
- API authentication and usage of API keys  
- Parsing JSON data from a weather API  
- Working with Twilio to send SMS messages  
- Using environment variables with `python-dotenv`  
- Basic automation setup for real-world scripts
