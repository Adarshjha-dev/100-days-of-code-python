### 📅 Day 20: Snake Game - Part 1 🐍

The first part of building the classic Snake Game using the `turtle` graphics module. This version sets up the game window, initializes the snake, and allows the player to control its movement.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Creates a game window using `turtle.Screen()`  
- Initializes a snake made of multiple segments  
- Allows player to control the snake with arrow keys  
- Updates the snake's movement continuously in the game loop

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Screen setup and creating a snake body  
- Animating the snake segments on screen  
- Creating a `Snake` class and moving to object-oriented programming  
- How to control the snake with keypress events  

#### 💻 Example
