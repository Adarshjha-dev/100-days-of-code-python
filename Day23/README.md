### 📅 Day 23: Turtle Crossing Game 🐢🚗

A simple arcade-style game built using the `turtle` module where the player guides a turtle across a busy road while avoiding incoming cars.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Moves the player (turtle) upward using the "Up" arrow key  
- Continuously spawns and moves cars from right to left  
- Detects collisions between the player and cars  
- Increases difficulty as the player progresses  
- Displays the current level and a game over message on collision

#### 📝 What I Learned
- How to create a turtle that moves in response to key presses  
- Building a `Car` class to generate and animate random cars  
- Detecting collisions between the turtle and moving cars  
- Recognizing when the turtle successfully reaches the finish line  
- Implementing a scoreboard with level progression and increasing car speed
