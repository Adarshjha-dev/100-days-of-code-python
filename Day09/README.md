### 📅 Day 9: Blind Auction Project

A simple Python program that simulates a silent auction where users place bids, and the highest bidder wins.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Prompts multiple users to enter their name and bid  
- Stores each bid in a dictionary  
- Clears the screen between entries for secrecy  
- Determines the highest bid and declares the winner  

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Python dictionaries  
- Nesting Lists and Dictionaries  
- Looping through dictionary keys  

#### 💻 Example
