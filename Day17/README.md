### 📅 Day 17: Quiz Project 🧠

A console-based quiz game that uses object-oriented programming principles to manage questions and track user progress.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Loads a list of questions and answers  
- Uses a `Question` class to represent each quiz item  
- Uses a `QuizBrain` class to manage question flow and scorekeeping  
- Asks each question and checks the user's answer  
- Tracks and displays the final score after completion

#### 📝 What I Learned
- How to create a Class in Python  
- Working with Attributes, Class Constructors and the `__init__()` function  
- Adding Methods to a Class  
- Managing program state using objects
