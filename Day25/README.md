### 📅 Day 25: U.S. States Game 🗺️

An interactive geography quiz game built with Turtle graphics and Pandas. The goal is to name all 50 U.S. states by typing them on the map.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Displays a blank map of the U.S. using Turtle graphics  
- Prompts the user to guess U.S. state names  
- Tracks correctly guessed states and writes them on the map  
- Allows the user to type `Exit` to stop the game early  
- Saves a `.csv` file (`missing_states.csv`) with states the user missed

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Reading CSV data in Python 
- Using Pandas DataFrames and Series to access tabular data  
- Accessing specific rows and columns from a DataFrame  
- Performing basic data analysis and filtering with Pandas  
- Working with Turtle graphics to draw text on a screen  
- Using coordinates from data to position elements on a visual map  
- Writing data back to a CSV file with `to_csv()`
