### 📅 Day 19: Turtle Race Game 🐢

A graphical race simulation built using Python's `turtle` module, where colorful turtles compete and the user places a bet on the winner.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Sets up a race track with six turtles, each a different color  
- Asks the user to bet on a turtle color  
- Moves each turtle forward by a random amount in a loop  
- Declares the winner once a turtle crosses the finish line  
- Displays whether the user won or lost based on their bet

#### 📝 What I Learned  
- Python higher order functions & event listeners  
- Object state and instance manipulation  
- The turtle coordinate system and positioning
