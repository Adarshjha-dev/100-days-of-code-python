### 📅 Day 38: Exercise Tracking with Nutritionix & Sheety 🏋️‍♂️

A Python automation tool that uses Nutritionix to analyze exercises from natural language and logs the workout details to a Google Sheet via Sheety.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Takes natural language input about exercises  
- Uses the Nutritionix API to parse the input and extract exercise data  
- Logs workout details (exercise, duration, calories) to a Google Sheet using Sheety  
- Uses Basic Auth to securely post to Sheety  
- Automatically timestamps each workout entry

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Get exercise stats with natural language queries using Nutritionix  
- Saving data into Google Sheets using POST requests  
- Authenticating Sheety API requests with Basic Authentication  
- Using environment variables to securely store credentials
