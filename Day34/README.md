### 📅 Day 34: GUI Quiz App ✅

A graphical quiz application built using object-oriented programming and Tkinter, where users can answer True/False questions in a clean and interactive interface.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Loads multiple-choice questions and answers from structured data  
- Uses OOP principles to manage questions (`Question`), quiz logic (`QuizBrain`), and UI (`QuizInterface`)  
- Displays one question at a time using a graphical interface  
- Updates score in real-time  
- Ends the quiz when there are no more questions  

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Creating and managing a class-based GUI using Tkinter  
- Unescaping HTML entities in question text  
- Using Python type hints and arrow syntax (`->`) for better readability and tooling  
- Maintaining separation of concerns in modular design
