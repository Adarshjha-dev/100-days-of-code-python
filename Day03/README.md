### 📅 Day 3: Treasure Island

A text-based adventure game where the player navigates a series of choices to find hidden treasure.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Presents a story with multiple decision points  
- Takes user input to branch the story  
- Ends the game with different outcomes based on choices

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Control flow using `if`, `elif`, and `else`  
- Nested conditional statements  
- Using multiple independent `if` statements  
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)  
- Normalizing input with `.lower()`
