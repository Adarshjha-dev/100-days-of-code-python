### 📅 Day 18: Hirst Dot Painting 🎨

A Python turtle graphics project inspired by Damien Hirst’s dot paintings. This program uses a predefined palette of RGB colors to create a 10x10 grid of colorful dots.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Uses the turtle graphics module to draw on-screen  
- Randomly selects colors from a predefined list  
- Draws a grid of 100 dots (10 rows x 10 columns)  
- Positions each dot with precise spacing  
- Adds color variation with `random.choice`

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Working with the turtle graphics module  
- Creating visual art programmatically  
- Importing modules, installing packages, and using aliases  
- Python tuples and how to generate random RGB colors
