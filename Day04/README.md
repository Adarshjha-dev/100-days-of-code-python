### 📅 Day 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A command-line version of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where you play against the computer.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Prompts the user to choose Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2)  
- Randomly selects the computer’s move  
- Displays both choices using ASCII art  
- Determines and displays the game result (Win, Lose, Draw)

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Importing and using the `random` module  
- Lists and List indexing  
- Index Errors and Working with Nested Lists  
- Basic game logic structure
