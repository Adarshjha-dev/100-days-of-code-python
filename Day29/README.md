### 📅 Day 29: Password Manager 🔐

A GUI-based password manager that allows users to securely store website credentials and generate strong, random passwords.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Generates secure passwords using random letters, symbols, and numbers  
- Automatically copies the generated password to the clipboard  
- Saves website, email, and password entries to a local file  
- Uses `tkinter` for a clean and interactive GUI  
- Includes input validation and confirmation dialogs

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Building GUI applications with `tkinter`  
- Using `grid()` layout and `columnspan` for widget positioning  
- Dialog Boxes and Pop-Ups in Tkinter (`messagebox`)  
- Writing to files for simple persistent storage  
- Using external libraries like `pyperclip` for clipboard interaction  
- Basic input validation and user confirmation handling
