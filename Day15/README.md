### 📅 Day 15: Coffee Machine ☕

A simulation of a coffee machine that handles drink selection, payment, resource tracking, and transaction logic via command-line interface.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Offers three types of drinks: espresso, latte, and cappuccino  
- Tracks available resources: water, milk, coffee  
- Checks if ingredients are sufficient before making a drink  
- Accepts coin input (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)  
- Calculates and returns change if needed  
- Maintains a running profit report  
- Allows turning off the machine or printing a report

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Creating New Project in PyCharm  
- Global variables and program state control  
- Implementing a basic transaction system with user input
