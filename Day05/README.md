### 📅 Day 5: PyPassword Generator

A Python program that generates secure passwords based on user-defined criteria like length, symbols, and numbers.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Asks the user how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want  
- Builds an "easy" password by combining them in order  
- Builds a "hard" password by shuffling the characters  
- Outputs both password types for comparison

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Using the `for` loop with Python lists  
- Looping over a sequence using `range()`
