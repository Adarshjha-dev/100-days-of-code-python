### 📅 Day 30: Password Manager with Search Functionality 🔎

Building on Day 29's password manager, this version adds the ability to search for stored credentials using the website name. All data is now saved in a structured JSON file for easier retrieval and management.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Searches for saved credentials by website name  
- Displays matching email and password using a popup  
- Stores and updates all data in a JSON file  
- Handles missing data and file-not-found errors gracefully

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Reading and updating JSON files using `json.load()` and `json.dump()`  
- Merging dictionaries to retain existing data  
- Implementing search functionality in a GUI  
- Exception handling with `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`  
- Raising your own exceptions and showing custom error messages
