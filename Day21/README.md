### 📅 Day 21: Snake Game - Part 2 🍎

Expanded the Snake Game to include scoring, food mechanics, wall collisions, and game over logic. The game is now interactive and complete with win/lose conditions.

#### 🧠 What It Does
- Detects collisions between the snake and food  
- Increases snake length and score when food is eaten  
- Ends game on collision with walls or snake’s own tail  
- Displays the score dynamically  
- Shows a game over message when the player loses

#### 📝 What I Learned
- Class inheritance
- How to slice lists and tuples in Python   
- Real-time game updates using the turtle module
